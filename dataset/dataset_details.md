# Dataset Details

## Overview
This project uses the **Sample Superstore Sales** dataset, a widely used dataset for data analysis and visualization. It contains **four years of sales data (2014â€“2017)** for a fictional Superstore, spanning **9,994 records** across three tables: `Orders`, `Returns`, and `People`.

## Source & Structure
The dataset originates from the **Tableau Community via Kaggle** and was provided as an [Excel (.xls) file](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls) with three sheets:

| Sheet   | Purpose                      | Rows   |
|---------|------------------------------|--------|
| Orders  | Main sales transaction data  | 9,994  |
| Returns | Flag for returned orders     | 296    |
| People  | Regional manager assignments | 4      |

For analysis, the dataset was converted into **MySQL tables**, maintaining the same structure.

## Database Structure

Each table contains key fields relevant to sales, returns, and management.

### Orders Table (Sales Transactions)
- `row_id`: Unique identifier for each row  
- `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order  
- `order_date`: Date of the order  
- `ship_date`: Date of shipment  
- `ship_mode`: Shipping method  
- `customer_id`: Unique customer identifier  
- `customer_name`: Name of the customer  
- `segment`: Customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)  
- `region`: Region of the sale (West, East, South, Central)  
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for the product  
- `category`: Product category (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture)  
- `sub_category`: Product sub-category (e.g., Phones, Chairs)  
- `product_name`: Name of the product  
- `sales`: Sales amount  
- `quantity`: Quantity sold  
- `discount`: Discount applied  
- `profit`: Profit amount  

### Returns Table (Returned Orders)
- `order_id`: Links to the `Orders` table  
- `returned`: Indicates if the order was returned (`Yes` / `No`)  

### People Table (Regional Management)
- `region`: Sales region  
- `person`: Assigned regional manager  

## Data Wrangling Steps
The original dataset required several wrangling steps to prepare it for analysis in MySQL:

1. **Initial Conversion of Smaller Files with UTF-8 Encoding**:
   - The smaller sheets (`Returns` and `People`) were converted first to test the import process, using UTF-8 encoding:
     - The `Returns` sheet was saved as `Superstore_Returns_utf8.csv`.
     - The `People` sheet was saved as `Superstore_People_utf8.csv`.
   - These UTF-8 encoded files caused import issues in MySQL, likely due to special characters or formatting.

2. **Switch to ASCII Encoding for All Files**:
   - After encountering issues with UTF-8, all three sheets were converted to CSV files using ASCII encoding:
     - The `Orders` sheet was saved as `Superstore_Orders_ascii.csv`.
     - The `Returns` sheet was saved as `Superstore_Returns_ascii.csv`.
     - The `People` sheet was saved as `Superstore_People_ascii.csv`.

3. **Column Reordering for Orders**:
   - The `Superstore_Orders_ascii.csv` file had issues with comma-separated values in the `product_name` column (due to overly detailed product names), causing misalignment during the MySQL import.
   - The columns were reordered to move `product_name` to the last column, creating `Superstore_Orders_Reordered.csv`.

4. **Import into MySQL**:
   - The reordered `Superstore_Orders_Reordered.csv` was imported into a temporary table (`temp_orders`) in MySQL.
   - Type conversion was applied (e.g., converting `order_date` to DATE, `sales` to DECIMAL) to create the final `orders` table.
   - `Superstore_Returns_ascii.csv` and `Superstore_People_ascii.csv` were imported into the `returns` and `people` tables, respectively.
   - These steps are documented in the [data_wrangling_mysql.sql](../../sql_scripts/data_wrangling_mysql.sql) script.

5. **View Creation**:
   - A view (`vw_superstore_analysis`) was created to join the `orders`, `returns`, and `people` tables for analysis.
   - This step is documented in the [data_preparation_mysql.sql](../../sql_scripts/data_preparation_mysql.sql) script.
