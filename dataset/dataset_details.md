# Dataset Details
 

 
## Overview
 
This project uses the **Sample Superstore Sales** dataset, a widely used dataset for data analysis and visualization. It contains **four years of sales data (2014â€“2017)** for a fictional Superstore, spanning **9,994 records** across three tables: `Orders`, `Returns`, and `People`.
 

 
## Source & Structure
 

The dataset originates from the **Tableau Community via Kaggle** and was provided as an [Excel (.xls) file](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls) with three sheets:
 

This dataset originates from the **Tableau Community via Kaggle** and was provided as an [Excel (.xls) file](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls) with three sheets:
 

 
| Sheet   | Purpose                      | Rows   |
 
|---------|------------------------------|--------|
 
| Orders  | Main sales transaction data  | 9,994  |
 
| Returns | Returned orders information  | 296    |
 
| People  | Regional manager assignments | 4      |
 

 
For analysis, the dataset was converted into **MySQL tables**, maintaining the same structure.
 

 
## Database Structure
 

 
Each table contains key fields relevant to sales, returns, and management.
 

 
### Orders Table (Sales Transactions)
 
- `row_id`: Unique identifier for each row  
 
- `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order  
 
- `order_date`: Date of the order  
 
- `ship_date`: Date of shipment  
 
- `ship_mode`: Shipping method  
 
- `customer_id`: Unique customer identifier  
 
- `customer_name`: Name of the customer  
 
- `segment`: Customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)  
 
- `region`: Region of the sale (West, East, South, Central)  
 
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for the product  
 
- `category`: Product category (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture)  
 
- `sub_category`: Product sub-category (e.g., Phones, Chairs)  
 
- `product_name`: Name of the product  
 
- `sales`: Sales amount  
 
- `quantity`: Quantity sold  
 
- `discount`: Discount applied  
 
- `profit`: Profit amount  
 

 
### Returns Table (Returned Orders)
 
- `order_id`: Links to the `Orders` table  
 
- `returned`: Indicates if the order was returned (`Yes` / `No`)  
 

 
### People Table (Regional Management)
 
- `region`: Sales region  
 
- `person`: Assigned regional manager  
 

 
## Data Wrangling Process
 

 
To prepare the dataset for MySQL analysis, several data transformation steps were required.
 

 
### 1. Initial CSV Conversion & Encoding Fixes
 
- The **Orders**, **Returns**, and **People** sheets were converted to CSV format.
 
- **UTF-8 encoding** caused import issues in MySQL (likely due to special characters).
 
- **Solution**: Re-encoded all files to **ASCII** for seamless MySQL import.
 

 
### 2. Column Reordering for MySQL Import
 
- The **Orders** sheet contained **comma-separated product names along with various special characters**, causing column misalignment.
 
- **Solution**: Moved `product_name` to the **last column**, preventing import errors.
 

 
### 3. MySQL Table Import & Type Conversion
 
- `Superstore_Orders_Reordered.csv` was first imported into a **temporary table** (`temp_orders`).
 
- **Data types** were adjusted (e.g., `order_date` â†’ `DATE`, `sales` â†’ `DECIMAL`).
 
- Final **Orders**, **Returns**, and **People** tables were created.
 

 
### 4. View Creation for Analysis
 
- A SQL **view** (`vw_superstore_analysis`) was created to integrate **Orders**, **Returns**, and **People** tables.
 
- This simplified the analysis by providing a **single unified dataset**.
 

 
### 5. Returns Table Limitation
 
- The **Returns** table only identifies returned orders, not individual returned products.
 
- As a result, return analysis is limited to the **order level**, not the **product level**.
 
- **Workaround**: Estimate product-level returns by joining Returns with Orders while assuming all items in a returned order were affected.
