# Superstore Sales Analysis

This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of the Superstore sales dataset, uncovering key profitability drivers across regions, product categories, and customer segments. The project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, joins, aggregations) and prepares the data for visualization in Tableau or Power BI.

## Project Overview
- **Portfolio Page**: View the full analysis and findings in the [SQL Sales Performance Analysis portfolio page](https://tonynick.notion.site/SQL-Sales-Performance-Analysis-1b99c67da0d480e0a7c7fa3377aaa935) hosted on Notion.
- **SQL Scripts**: Located in the [sql_scripts](https://github.com/tony1142/superstore-sales-analysis/tree/main/sql_scripts) folder, including data wrangling, preparation, exploratory queries, and regional sales analysis.
- **CSV Outputs**: Results of the SQL analysis, ready for Tableau/Power BI, in the [csv_outputs](https://github.com/tony1142/superstore-sales-analysis/tree/main/csv_outputs) folder.
